Matrix multiplication is a mathematical operation used to combine two matrices to produce a new matrix. The process of matrix multiplication involves multiplying the elements of rows from the first matrix by the corresponding elements of columns from the second matrix and summing up the results. The resulting matrix will have dimensions determined by the number of rows in the first matrix and the number of columns in the second matrix.

Matrix multiplication is defined as follows:

Suppose you have two matrices, A and B.

Matrix A with dimensions (m x n):

a11  a12  ...  a1n
a21  a22  ...  a2n
...  ...  ...  ...
am1  am2  ...  amn

Matrix B with dimensions (n x p):

b11  b12  ...  b1p
b21  b22  ...  b2p
...  ...  ...  ...
bn1  bn2  ...  bnp

STEPS:::

1.Define the Matrices: Start by defining the matrices you want to multiply. You'll need to declare two-dimensional arrays to represent these matrices. Define the sizes and initialize the values of the matrices A and B.

2.Declare Variables: Declare variables to store the dimensions of the matrices and the resulting matrix C.

3.Matrix Multiplication Function: Write a function to perform the matrix multiplication. This function should take the matrices A and B, their dimensions, and a matrix to store the result as parameters. Inside the function, use nested loops to calculate the elements of the result matrix.

4.Call the Function: In your main function, call the multiplyMatrices function with the matrices A and B and the dimensions of the matrices. Provide the result matrix to store the result of the multiplication.

5.Display the Result: After calling the multiplication function, you can display the resulting matrix C using nested loops.

6.Compile and Run: Compile your C program and run it to perform the matrix multiplication and display the result.
